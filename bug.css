The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results when dealing with percentages and other units if the order of operations is not carefully considered.  For example, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not work as intended if the containing element's width is not explicitly set.  The calculation happens after the parent width is determined, potentially leading to incorrect values. Another issue is that invalid calculations may not throw a clear error, but instead may lead to unexpected rendering.
